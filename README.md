# Machine Learning Portfolio #

This repository showcases a collection of projects where I explore various machine learning and AI techniques. Each project represents my journey into solving real-world problems using data-driven approaches.
## What's Coming ##
- Data Exploration & Analysis: I plan to showcase my work on cleaning and visualizing data
- Predictive Modeling: Expect projects where I build and evaluate various predictive models
- Deep Learning Experiments: Iâ€™m exploring neural networks and deep learning techniques

Stay tuned for updates as I add new projects and improve this repository.
